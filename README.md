# Audible Dataset Analysis
## Overview
This project involves analyzing Audible audiobook data to uncover insights into top authors and narrators based on ratings and revenue. The analysis aims to identify trends and potential investment opportunities by leveraging data from 2021 and 2022.

## Datasets
Audible_uncleaned.csv: The original, raw dataset containing comprehensive data on audiobooks, including odd and special characters due to a known glitch.
Audible_clean.csv: The cleaned and processed dataset, ready for analysis. Special and odd characters identified in the "Audible_uncleaned" dataset were ignored and removed based on instructor advice, as these anomalies were not present in the original source data.
Due to technical constraints, the original dataset cannot be uploaded directly to this repository as it gets corrupted upon transfer.

## Cleaning Process
The cleaning process involved removing anomalies and ensuring data integrity for accurate analysis. For detailed steps on how the dataset was cleaned and prepared for analysis, refer to the documentation provided in the project's PDF guide.

## Tableau Dashboard
The final analysis is presented in a Tableau dashboard, offering a visual representation of key findings, including top authors and narrators by ratings and revenue in 2021 and 2022. The dashboard provides insights into engagement levels and the financial impact of various authors and narrators on the platform.
